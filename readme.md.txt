# Book Discovery Assistant (RAG)
A next-gen platform designed to help users discover books they'll love and get insightful answers about their favourite reads. While the platform holds a wealth of book data, its current keyword-based search falls short when handling nuanced queries. Readers like Emma, who ask things like "Which biographies of inventors are both engaging and informative?" or "What fantasy novels focus on strong character development?"â€”often receive unsatisfying results. Your task is to build a system that deeply understands user intent, retrieves relevant information, and delivers personalized, conversational book recommendations that enhance the discovery experience.

## Setup

Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines advanced vector search techniques with the natural language understanding capabilities of GPT-4. The result should be an intuitive platform that bridges the gap between users and their ideal book discoveries.
